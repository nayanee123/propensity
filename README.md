# propensity:

(Propensity Model to identify how likely certain target groups customers respond to the marketing campaign)
Are you aware of what, when, and why your customers will make a purchase? Many businesses undertake an intense pursuit to discover these answers, dedicating valuable resources to data-driven campaigns and high-cost strategies - yet the actual outcomes often remain elusive and disappointing.
Customer information is considered to be a valuable asset, however its true worth can only be established when it is used. Many companies have large collections of data that appear to be impressive, but upon further examination, they may contain outdated or unimportant information. 
Propensity modeling is a method that aims to forecast the chance that individuals, leads, and customers will engage in specific actions. This method uses statistical analysis which takes into account all the independent and confounding factors that impact customer behavior.
Suppose you are working for a company as a Data Scientist. Your company is commissioned by an insurance company to develop a tool to optimize their marketing efforts.
#This project is aimed at building a propensity model to identify potential customers.
